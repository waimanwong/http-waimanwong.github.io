title: Laws of time management

I finally found the time management laws !!!

During my career, I have worked on many projects which failed due to a bad management of the time.
Most the laws below are the reasons of these failures.

**Pareto's Principle**
20% of our activity produces 80% of our results
It means to separate the essential from the accessory in the company's core business. And follow these 3 simple rules: prioritize, say no and delegate non-essential tasks

**Carson's Law** or Law of homogeneous sequences
Continuous work takes less time and energy than when performed in several steps
Grouping same nature tasks, protecting ourselves from distractions

**Law of Illich**  or Law of decreasing performance
Beyond a certain effort threshold, human efficiency decreases
Take breaks to be more productive

**Hofstadter's Law** Or Murphy's Law
Everything takes longer than expected
Be aware and plan in advance, keeping some spare time

**Law of Parkinson**
The more time we have to complete a task, the more time it will take
Work tends to spread out so as to occupy the time available for its completion. Set realistic deadlines, make regular checks to assess project's progress

**Laborit's Rule** or The least effort law
Human behavior prompts us to first do what pleases us. We instinctively tend to "seek immediate satisfaction" and "escape stress"
Start the day by organizing it according to a grid of difficulties. Begin with the most difficult tasks and reward yourself

Here is how I deal with the time management.

I spend my time in the public transport to organize my day, planning what I am going to do (something it is the pseudo code I am going to write).

I also focus on simple and "small" tasks where the bounds are well defined. Divide and conquer is my friend :)

With all of these, I am able to play all the day in my mind so I optimize my work day.

I also try not being interrupted by mails, phones but I stop my work when someone comes to see me (I am still a human being ...).
